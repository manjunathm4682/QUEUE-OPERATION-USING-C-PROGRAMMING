# QUEUE-OPERATION-USING-C-PROGRAMMING
The Queue Operation project demonstrates how to manage a queue data structure in C, utilizing both singly linked lists (SLL) and doubly linked lists (DLL). Users can perform essential queue operations and explore the differences between these two implementations.

**Features**<br>
**Enqueue Operation**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.<br>
**Dequeue Operation**: Remove the front element from the queue.<br>
**Display Operation**: View all elements in the queue from front to rear.<br>
<br>**Project Files**<br>
**SLL Implementation**: Contains the source code for queue operations using a singly linked list.<br>
**DLL Implementation**: Contains the source code for queue operations using a doubly linked list.<br>
<br>**How It Works**<br>
**Enqueue Operation**: Elements are added to the rear of the queue, with pointers updated as needed in both SLL and DLL implementations.<br>
**Dequeue Operation**: The front element is removed from the queue, with pointers adjusted accordingly.<br>
**Display Operation**: All elements in the queue are displayed, starting from the front and moving to the rear.<br>
